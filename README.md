# marbles

A completely impractical programming language where you let a marble fall.

## Overview

Execution begins at the character `V`, which "drops" a marble. The marble
"falls" by continuing downwards until a character is reached. Some characters
are used for specific actions; all others can be used as variables. Comments
can be placed anywhere where a marble will not fall and don't need any special
notation.

## Examples

Hello World:

```
V

P
"
H
e
l
l
o
,

w
o
r
l
d
"

R
0
```
